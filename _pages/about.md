## About Me

Hello! I am Biagio Mandracchia, a Ram√≥n y Cajal Research Fellow at the University of Valladolid. My primary research interest lies in the field of fluorescence microscopy and image restoration. Over the years, I have dedicated my efforts to developing innovative techniques aimed at enhancing the clarity and quality of microscopic images. These advancements are crucial for various scientific fields, enabling researchers to observe and analyze biological processes with greater precision.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on:

- **Fluorescence Microscopy**: Exploring the fundamentals and applications of fluorescence microscopy to provide deeper insights into cellular and molecular structures.
- **Image Restoration**: Developing advanced algorithms and methods for restoring and enhancing microscopic images, making them clearer and more accurate for scientific analysis.
- **Optical Imaging Techniques**: Investigating new optical imaging methods to push the boundaries of what can be visualized and quantified at the microscopic level.

## Current Projects

- **Physically-informed Image Restoration**: This project focuses on creating algorithms that significantly improve resolution and reliability of fluorescence microscopy images by modeling optical systems and imaging detectors. This research aims to provide more detailed and accurate visualizations of cellular interfaces and dynamics.
  
- **High-speed imaging and microfluidics**: Working on novel microscopy techniques high-speed and high-throughput imaging for rapid exploration of biodynamics using fluorescence microscopy and microfluidics.
  
- **Imaging for diagnostics**: Developing methods for fast, automated diagnostics through computational microscopy. In particular, we are studying new ways to detect pathogens and observe the effects of various treatments on cells without the need for fluorescent labels.
