excerpt: 'We report a new technique to measure direction and amplitude of electric felds generated by microelectrodes embedded in polar liquid environment, as often used in microfuidic devices. The method is based on optical tweezers which act as sensitive force transducer while a trapped charged microsphere behaves as a probe. When an electric feld is applied the particles moves from its equilibrium position and fnishes in a new equilibrium position where electric and optical forces are balanced.A trapped bead is moved to explore the electric feld in a wide region around the microelectrodes. In such way maps of electric felds with high spatial resolution can be reconstructed even for complex electrode geometries where numerical simulation approaches can fail. Experimental results are compared with calculations based on fnite element analysis simulation. © 2011 by the Author(s); licensee Accademia Peloritana dei Pericolanti, Messina, Italy.'
