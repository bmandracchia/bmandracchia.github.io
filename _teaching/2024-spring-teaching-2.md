### Brief Description
---

The course provides the necessary tools to work rigorously with signals and systems in various fields. Processes as diverse as digital television signal processing, digital photography, RADAR signal, GPS, radio transmission, audio and video compression, etc., are all based on the analysis tools that will be covered throughout the course.

### Objectives
---

- Understand the concept of "signal" and "system," as well as their different types.
- Know the main problems in signal processing and see examples of signals and their application areas.
- Understand the difference between continuous and discrete signals and systems, as well as their notation and representation in signal theory.
- Know the basic types of signals and their characteristics.
- Understand the different types of signal symmetry and be able to decompose a signal based on these symmetries.
- Comprehend the concept of periodicity and fundamental period.
- Know the parameters of interest for a signal and understand what energy signals and power signals are.
- Know the types of systems, with special attention to LTI systems, be able to analyze their properties, and understand the types of interconnections to form more complex systems.
- Understand the concepts of signal bases and system characterization.
- Perform basic signal processing operations, with special attention to convolution.
- Analyze systems and model their characteristics.
