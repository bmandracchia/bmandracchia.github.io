### Brief Description
---

Laboratories of Optics, and Electricity and Magnetism; Data analysis techniques; Basic statistics.

### Learning Outcomes 
---

- To acquire knowledge of principles, analysis techniques, measurement instruments and
experimental phenomena of interest in Electricity and Magnetism and Optics.
- To acquire the skill in handling measuring devices and instrumentation.
- To evaluate the limits of measurement methods due to interference, the simplicity of the models
and from the effects that are neglected in the method of measurement.
- To be capable to prepare a report and to document a measurement process in respect to the
fundamental principles, the required instrumentation and the results presentation.
- To analyze the obtained experimental results and to draw conclusions using statistical techniques.

### Theoretical classes
---

The fundamental principles of the main characterization techniques used in Electricity, Magnetism,
and Optics will be introduced, and some essential concepts, necessary for the follow-up of the
practical sessions, will be reviewed.
Lectures in Optics will be focused on explaining basic concepts of Geometrical Optics:
- Lens and mirror imaging.
- Optical elements and systems.
- Optical instruments.
