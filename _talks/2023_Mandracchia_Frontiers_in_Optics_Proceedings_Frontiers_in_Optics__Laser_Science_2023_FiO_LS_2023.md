excerpt: 'In fluorescence microscopy, the quality of the acquired images determines the extent of observable biological phenomena. To address the different noise sources degrading these images, we introduce a model-based framework compatible with several microscopy systems independently from the detector used.'

In fluorescence microscopy, the quality of the acquired images determines the extent of observable biological phenomena. To address the different noise sources degrading these images, we introduce a model-based framework compatible with several microscopy systems independently from the detector used.
