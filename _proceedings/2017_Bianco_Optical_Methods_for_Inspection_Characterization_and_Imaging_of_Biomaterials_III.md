excerpt: 'The development of tools for rapid food quality inspection is a highly pursued goal. These could be valuable devices to be used by food producers in factories or the customers themselves in specific installations at the marketplace. Here we show how speckle patterns in coherent imaging systems can be can be employed as indicators of the presence of bacteria colonies contaminating food or water. Speckle decorrelation is induced by the self-propelling movement of these organisms when they interact with coherent light. Hence, their presence can be detected using a simple setup in a condition in which the single element cannot be imaged, but the properties of the ensemble can be exploited. Thanks to the small magnification factor we set, our system can inspect a large Field-of-View (FoV). We show the possibility to discriminate between fresh and contaminated food, thus paving the way to the rapid food quality testing by consumers at the marketplace.'
