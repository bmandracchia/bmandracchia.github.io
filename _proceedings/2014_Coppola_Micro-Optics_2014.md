excerpt: 'In the case of light emitting semiconducting polymers, different techniques have been used for the fabrication of electroluminescent devices. Experiments and characterizations have been carried out at different operating voltages and for voltage dependent emission color also combining the processability of organic materials with efficient luminescence displayed by inorganic nanocrystals (NCs). In fact, the experimental perspective to disperse emitting colloidal NCs into polymers has allowed to further engineer hybrid organic-inorganic materials introducing innovative functionalities as for instance photoluminescence conversion capabilities. This has proved of great interest for novel applications such as the fabrication of photonic crystals and, notably, of innovative solar cells showing enhanced efficiency. Here we report on the fabrication of novel active micro-optical elements made by a mixture of rod-shaped inorganic NCs dispersed into poly-dimethylsiloxane. ? 2014 SPIE.'
