title: "Through-the-objective holographic surface plasmon resonance imaging for quantitative measurement of thin film thickness"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2016_Mandracchia_Quantitative_Phase_Imaging_II
excerpt: '? 2016 SPIE.We built and tested a Holographic Surface Plasmon Resonance (HoloSPR) objective-based microscope for simultaneous amplitude-contrast and phase-contrast Surface Plasmon Resonance imaging (SPRi). SPRi is a widely spread tool for label-free detection of changes in refractive index and concentration, as well as mapping of thin films. However, to obtain quantitative data of thin film thickness, usually scanning techniques have to be employed. Thanks to the simultaneous detection of amplitude and phase, we show that HoloSPRi provides a versatile imaging tool for high-throughput SPR detection, which yields, moreover, the possibility of non-scanning quantitative measurements of thin film thickness.'
