Novel and intriguing lithographic approaches based on instabilities of liquid polymers and electro-hydro-dynamic at nanoscale have been developed. The unusual fabrication methods were aimed at fabricating 3D polymeric microstructures. A variety of microstructures were fabricated and tested for applications in different fields.
